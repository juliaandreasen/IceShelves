	<h3> Profile </h3>
	<p> I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Land and Atmospheric Science at the University of Minnesota under Dr. Peter Neff. My research will use a combination of remotely-sensed satellite images, ground-based observations (ice cores), and climate reanalysis data to gain a better understanding of mass balance and climate along 
		the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) coastline. You can check out Dr. Neff's research (found <a href="http://peterneff.weebly.com/">here</a>).
</p>
<p>		
		In the Fall of 2019, I graduated from the University of Leeds where I received a Master of Research degree in Climate and Atmospheric Science.
		Through the supervision of Dr. Anna Hogg, my research included the observation of 31 Antarctic ice shelves over the past decade to track areas of both ice growth/loss. This website provides a snapshot of this research, displaying the calving front evolution for 9 of the 31 ice shelves.
		This research was completed through the collection of satellite MODIS imagery (found <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/iceshelves_images/index_modis.html">here</a>), QGIS tracing of the calving fronts, and measuring of Antarctica's ice shelf area changes per year.
		Through my affiliation with the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM), this project is projected to aid in future research concerning the longevity and stability of Antarctica's ice shelves.
</p>
<p>
		Prior to the University of Leeds, I graduated from The Ohio State University (Spring 2018) with a Bachelor of Science in Atmospheric Science.
		This program fostered my intrigue into climatology and its impacts on all regions of the world.
		As an undergraduate student, I worked in two separate research groups. The first research group, Dr. Bryan Mark and Jim Degrand's Great Basin Expedition (GBEX), investigated a paleoclimatological fire history through sediment charcoal obtained from Great Basin National Park, Nevada.
		Completing field work in Nevada for two summers (2016, 2017) confirmed my love for both research and the observation of climatological effects on Earth's surface.
		The second research group, Dr. Steven Quiring's Climate Analytics Lab, focused on improving the accuracy of hurricane power outage forecasts by identifying where models performed well and where they performed poorly.
		This project furthered my appreciation for big data science, specifically working in programs like python, MATLAB, and GIS.
