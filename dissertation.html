	<p>
		As the world’s largest cryospheric region, Antarctica is constantly enduring dynamic stages of ice growth/loss. These changes mainly occur on the continent’s coastline, 75% of which is made up of ice shelves.
		Calving in these regions has long been recorded as a major threat to the stability of ice shelves and the overall rate of ice mass reduction.
		Its unpredictable nature is reflected through the fluctuating glacial ice dispersion in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), and East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS).
		Ice shelf collapse through calving not only reflects current environmental factors/forcings, but also maintains lasting and impactful effects on the grounded ice of glaciers, subsequently leading to sea level rise.
		Overall, this project is the first to create a comprehensive database of calving front locations, and their area changes, in all three sectors of Antarctica (AP, EAIS, and WAIS).
		As a standardized measurement of calved distances, this research utilizes the most recent MODIS satellite imagery available, and plots/traces them individually in QGIS.
		Analysing the ice shelves on an annual basis, for the past 10 years, provides an innovative and dense collection of circum-Antarctic calving data.

<a name="ScientificRationale"><h4> Scientific Rationale </h4></a>
<p> Cryospheric ice loss through calving has increasingly become a prevalent issue for Antarctica and ice shelf endurance. This is evident through both drastic land-based glacial front migration and rising sea levels (Benn et al., 2007) (Shepherd et al., 2012).
	As a process by which large sections of glaciers break off and form icebergs, calving is neither a predictable nor methodical form of ablation (Dalrymple et al., 2012).
	The individual ice shelves of Antarctica fluctuate in how prone their glaciers are to calve, making it an impossible process to generalize for the entire continent (Rignot et al., 2013).
	For this reason, ice shelves need to be individually analysed in order to understand what specifically may be the cause of ice ablation or accumulation in that region.
	Historical calving front data is crucial for this process because it informs scientists on which ice shelves are the most susceptible to continued ablation, helping establish future calving projections.
	However, the existing research in this field either focuses on one or two individual ice shelves/glaciers in high-resolution detail or evaluates large sections of coastline on a generalized/low-resolution analysis (Baumhoer et al., 2018).
	According to Baumhoer et al., “No review paper exists that allows a comprehensive overview on available ice shelf and glacier front positions along the Antarctic coastline” (2018, p. 3).
	As a remedy, this project focuses on calving around the entirety of the continent to track and measure specifical areal ice migration on an in-depth level. This is to help understand why calving occurs and where it may happen again.
</p>
<a name="Objectives"><h4> Objectives </h4></a>
<p> The main goal for this project is to create an updated and cohesive dataset of calving front locations (CFL) over the past 10 years for Antarctica’s major ice shelves.
	In order to achieve the best quality of analysis, MODIS satellite imagery will be extracted and studied in QGIS, using Quantarctica data as an Antarctic basemap.
	Ice shelves will be studied in all three regions of the continent (AP, EAIS, WAIS).
	In the Antarctic Peninsula, Cook et al., 2005, created a comprehensive time-series of ice-front movement around the Peninsula from 1940 to 2002. This data, was then updated by Cook and Vaughan (2010) to include data from 2002 to 2009.
	This collection is a baseline of research for the AP and provides a strong starting point for continued and consistent CFL analysis.
	For both the East and West Antarctica ice sheets, this project will take a similar approach to either find and update historical data, or provide foundational/initial calving data starting in 2009.
	These calving fronts allow for the measurement of an ice shelf's annual area, as well as the difference/rate of area change per year.
<p>The specific objectives for this research include:</p>
<p> 1. Extract and analyze MODIS satellite imagery for the Antarctica Peninsula from 2009-
2018/19 to update Cook and Vaughan’s (2010) time-series dataset. </p>
<p> 2. Extract and analyze MODIS satellite imagery for West and East Antarctica from 2009- 2018/19 to either update existing calving front migration datasets or create foundational
data for ice shelves without previous CFL data. </p>
<p> 3. Calculate the overall area of ice shelves per year, as well as the annual distance between calving front locations, to calculate ice shelf migration rates over the past 10 years. </p>
